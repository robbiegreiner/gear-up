As we watch Kathy Sierra's video and read Ta-Nehisi Coates' article, pay attention to both presenters' assumptions about your agency as a learner. What new ideas do they introduce about 1) your awareness of your learning experience, 2) the efficacy of your learning experience, 3) and your overall mindset as a learner?
